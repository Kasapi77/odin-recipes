<p><em>We use this onion rings recipe as a burger topper to add an extra element to already fantastic burgers. These onion rings are also perfect for giving your salads a little crunch. â€”Taste of Home Test Kitchen, Milwaukee, Wisconsin</em></p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ui>
<li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>1/2 cup water</li>
<li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
<li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>1 large onion, very thinly sliced</li>
<li>Oil for deep-fat frying</li>
</ui>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<oi>
<li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
<li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
<li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.</li>
<li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.</li>
